"""list-cups-printers.py

List the available printer queues installed on the local computer.
You will identify the available printer installed on CUPS (see
  all de demo*.* files for more informations).

We do expect to find the "zebra-raw" printer.
  
if you are using a Zebra USB printer on a Linux Machine, you should
have a look to zebra-cups-minimal.py

Before starting this script, you should have a look to the demo-x.x files
where you will learn lots of things.
